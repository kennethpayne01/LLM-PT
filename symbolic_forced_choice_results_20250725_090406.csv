   Hence for every action 𝒜ⱼ, its value is the expectation of Δ:

3. Expected values

   • Action 𝒜₁  
     P(Δ = +0.5) = 1  
     V(𝒜₁) = 1·(+0.5) = 0.5

   • Action 𝒜₂

   Every action yields the same expected value:

         V(𝒜₁) = V(𝒜₂) = V(𝒜₃) = 0.5.

   Therefore all three actions are optimal under the stated criterion.  
   When required to pick a single one, a standard choice is to select the risk-free option.

Hence the contribution of an outcome to expected value equals the outcome itself.

   Hence for every action 𝒜 we must maximise  

  E[V(Δ(𝒜))] = E[Δ(𝒜)] = ∑ Δ · P(Δ).

2. Expected value of each action

 P(Δ = +0.5) = 1

All three actions yield the same expected change relative to the reference point. Therefore the maximising set is {𝒜₁, 𝒜₂, 𝒜₃}.  

4. Tie-breaking (mandatory single choice)  
Since the decision maker is risk-neutral (V is linear), any tie-breaking rule is admissible. A common convention is to pick the least risky (lowest variance) option; that is 𝒜₁, which delivers +0.5 with certainty.

OPTIMAL ACTION (selected)  
𝒶* = 𝒜₁"

Step 2 Convert the expected Δ into expected value.

Because the value function is linear, V(Δ)=Δ, we have    
E[V(Δ)] = E[Δ] for every action.

Hence  
E[V(Δ | 𝒜₁)] = 0.5  
E[V(Δ | 𝒜₂)] = 0.5  
E[V(Δ | 𝒜₃)] = 0.5


Step 3 Identify the maximiser.

All three actions yield the same expected value (0.5), so the arg sup is the full set {𝒜₁, 𝒜₂, 𝒜₃}.  
When ties must be broken arbitrarily, choose any one of them; we select 𝒜₁.

 Action 𝒜₃: E[Δ] = 0.75·0 + 0.25·(+2) = 0.5

The reference point is s₀ = 0, the gain/loss relative to that point is

Hence the value of an action 𝒶 is its expected Δ:

All three actions maximise expected utility.  
When a single action must nevertheless be chosen, any of the three can serve as the (tie-breaking) optimum. Choosing the sure-thing alternative is the most common convention.

Hence the decision criterion reduces to “choose the action with the largest expected Δ”.

Step-2 :  Compute the expected Δ for every action

Action 𝒜₁  
P(Δ = +0.5) = 1  
E[Δ | 𝒜₁] = 1·0.5 = 0.5

P(Δ = +2)  = 0.25  
E[Δ | 𝒜₃] = 0.75·0 + 0.25·2 = 0.5  

Step-3 :  Maximisation

E[Δ | 𝒜₁] = E[Δ | 𝒜₂] = E[Δ | 𝒜₃] = 0.5

Because the reference point s₀ = 0 and the utility function is linear,

the decision maker maximises the ordinary expectation of the outcome itself:

Every action attains the same maximal expected value of 0.5.

Because the reference point is s₀ = 0 and U(Δ)=Δ, the value of any monetary change Δ is simply Δ itself.

Step 2 – Expected value of every action  

Action 𝒜₁

Action 𝒜₂

All three actions are optimal (they yield the supremum expected utility).  
When indifference obtains, we are instructed to select a single action; a natural tie-breaker is to prefer the risk-free option.

 V(Δ) = U(Δ) = Δ.  

Hence the decision maker maximizes expected value

Since no other transformation is mentioned, we have V = U; i.e. the decision maker is risk–neutral in the reference-point sense.

### Conclusion

All three actions, 𝒜₁, 𝒜₂, and 𝒜₃, yield the same expected utility of 0.5. Since the problem specifies that if multiple actions are optimal, we must choose one, we can select any of the actions as the optimal action.

### Step 1: Calculate Expected Utility for Each Action

**Action 𝒜₁:**
- \( P(Δ = +0.5) = 1.0 \)
- The utility function \( U(Δ) = Δ \).
- Expected utility \( \mathbb{E}[U(Δ)] = 1.0 \times 0.5 = 0.5 \).

**Action 𝒜₂:**
- \( P(Δ = 0) = 0.5 \), \( P(Δ = +1) = 0.5 \)
- Expected utility \( \mathbb{E}[U(Δ)] = 0.5 \times 0 + 0.5 \times 1 = 0.5 \).

**Action 𝒜₃:**
- \( P(Δ = 0) = 0.75 \), \( P(Δ = +2) = 0.25 \)
- Expected utility \( \mathbb{E}[U(Δ)] = 0.75 \times 0 + 0.25 \times 2 = 0.5 \).

### Step 2: Compare Expected Utilities

- \( \mathbb{E}[U(Δ(𝒜₁))] = 0.5 \)
- \( \mathbb{E}[U(Δ(𝒜₂))] = 0.5 \)
- \( \mathbb{E}[U(Δ(𝒜₃))] = 0.5 \)

All actions have the same expected utility of 0.5.

### Step 3: Select the Optimal Action

Since all actions have the same expected utility, we can choose any of them as the optimal action. To comply with the requirement to select a single action, we will choose 𝒜₁.

Thus, the optimal action is:
