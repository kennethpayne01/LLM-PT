Step 2 Compute the expectation under each available action

• Action 𝒜₁  
 P(Δ = +0.5) = 1  
 𝔼[Δ | 𝒜₁] = 1·(+0.5) = 0.5.

• Action 𝒜₂  
 P(Δ = 0) = 0.5, P(Δ = +1) = 0.5  
 𝔼[Δ | 𝒜₂] = 0.5·0 + 0.5·(+1) = 0.5.

• Action 𝒜₃  
 P(Δ = 0) = 0.75, P(Δ = +2) = 0.25  
 𝔼[Δ | 𝒜₃] = 0.75·0 + 0.25·(+2) = 0.5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 Compare expected values

𝔼[Δ | 𝒜₁] = 𝔼[Δ | 𝒜₂] = 𝔼[Δ | 𝒜₃] = 0.5.

Therefore all three actions yield exactly the same expected utility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 Determine the arg sup

Let  
 𝒶* = arg sup_{𝒶∈{𝒜₁,𝒜₂,𝒜₃}} 𝔼[V(Δ(𝒶))].

Since each action attains the maximal value 0.5, the set of maximisers is

 𝒶* = {𝒜₁, 𝒜₂, 𝒜₃}.

- \( s_0 = -2 \)

- \( V(\Delta) = \Delta \)

### Actions:

- \( \mathbb{E}[V(\Delta(\mathcal{A}_2))] = 0.5 \)
- \( \mathbb{E}[V(\Delta(\mathcal{A}_3))] = 0.5 \)

### Actions and their Probabilities:

1. **Action \( \mathcal{A}_1 \)**:
   - \( P(\Delta = +0.5) = 1.0 \)

2. **Action \( \mathcal{A}_2 \)**:
   - \( P(\Delta = 0) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(\Delta = +1) = 0.5 \)

3. **Action \( \mathcal{A}_3 \)**:
   - \( P(\Delta = 0) = 0.75 \)
   - \( P(\Delta = +2) = 0.25 \)

### Expected Utility Calculation:

For each action, we calculate the expected utility \( \mathbb{E}[U(\Delta(\mathcal{A}))] \).

#### Action \( \mathcal{A}_1 \):

\[
\mathbb{E}[U(\Delta(\mathcal{A}_1))] = 1.0 \times 0.5 = 0.5
\]

#### Action \( \mathcal{A}_2 \):

\[
\mathbb{E}[U(\Delta(\mathcal{A}_2))] = 0.5 \times 0 + 0.5 \times 1 = 0.5
\]

Given:
- The utility function \( U(Δ) = Δ \).
- The reference point \( s₀ = 0 \).

### Evaluation of Actions

The utility function is given as \( U(Δ) = Δ \). Therefore, the expected utility for each action can be calculated as follows:

#### Action 𝒜₁:
- \( P(Δ = +0.5) = 1.0 \)
- Expected utility: 
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[U(Δ)] = 1.0 \times 0.5 = 0.5

#### Action 𝒜₂:
- \( P(Δ = 0) = 0.5 \), \( P(Δ = +1) = 0.5 \)
- Expected utility:
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[U(Δ)] = 0.5 \times 0 + 0.5 \times 1 = 0.5
  \]

#### Action 𝒜₃:
- \( P(Δ = 0) = 0.75 \), \( P(Δ = +2) = 0.25 \)
- Expected utility:
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[U(Δ)] = 0.75 \times 0 + 0.25 \times 2 = 0.5

### Step 1: Calculate the Expected Utility for Each Action

#### Action 𝒜₁:
- \( P(Δ = +0.5) = 1.0 \)
- The utility function \( U(Δ) = Δ \).
- Therefore, the expected utility for 𝒜₁ is:

#### Action 𝒜₃:
- \( P(Δ = 0) = 0.75 \), \( P(Δ = +2) = 0.25 \)
- The expected utility for 𝒜₃ is:
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[U(Δ)] = 0.75 \times 0 + 0.25 \times 2 = 0.5

### Step 2: Compare the Expected Utilities

- \( \mathbb{E}[U(Δ(𝒜₁))] = 0.5 \)
- \( \mathbb{E}[U(Δ(𝒜₂))] = 0.5 \)
- \( \mathbb{E}[U(Δ(𝒜₃))] = 0.5 \)

All actions have the same expected utility of 0.5.

1. **Action \( \mathcal{A}_1 \)**:
   - \( P(\Delta = +0.5) = 1.0 \)

2. **Action \( \mathcal{A}_2 \)**:
   - \( P(\Delta = 0) = 0.5 \)

- \( \mathbb{E}[U(\Delta(\mathcal{A}_2))] = 0.5 \)
- \( \mathbb{E}[U(\Delta(\mathcal{A}_3))] = 0.5 \)

Since all actions yield the same expected utility, we are indifferent among them. Therefore, the optimal action \( \mathcal{A}^* \) can be any of \( \mathcal{A}_1 \), \( \mathcal{A}_2 \), or \( \mathcal{A}_3 \).
